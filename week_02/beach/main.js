// Write a program that, given a minimum temperature and a maximum rainfall forecast, output a list of day you can go to the beach.

// example:
// with the following forecast:

// monday: the temperature is 20 and there is 12mm of rain
// tuesday: the temperature is 25 and there is 6mm of rain
// wednesday: the temperature is 27 and there is 24mm of rain
// thursday: the temperature is 32 and there is 65mm of rain
// friday: the temperature is 18 and there is 2mm of rain
// saturday: the temperature is 26 and there is 0mm of rain
// sunday: the temperature is 27 and there is 14mm of rain
// If i'm ok to go to the beach with a temperature at least 24 degrees and no more than 8mm of rain, the output of the program should be : Tuesday and Saturday

// Hint:
// Wisely choose a way to store you data (array, object,...)
